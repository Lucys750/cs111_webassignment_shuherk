  <h1> Madeline Shuherk</h1>
  <body> <p>I am Madeline and I am a communications studies major at <a href="Huntington.edu">Huntington University </a>. I chose to go to Huntington University to strengthen my relationship with God and understand my faith. While that is the main reason, the deciding factor was my mom being a proffesor here. With her being a professor, I get a decent dsicount.
    <br> I like singing and watching musicals. I was in show choir at my high school. I auditioned for HU's Joyful Noise but was not invited. My freshman year at HU, I was a television production major. 
  <br> My family has alot of animals. We have three dogs: Blue, Eddie and Ralphie. Along with our dogs, we have multiple chickens and have had mutliple gerbils, turtles, and fish. I am the oldest in my family with a younger brother who will be attending HU in the fall and a younger sister who will attend in two falls. </p>
